# LSL3PnC
 Leisure Suit Larry 3 Point and Click SCI0 mod. This is a colaboration between myself and Spanish Translator and Programmer <a href="https://pakolmo.netlify.app/larry3pnc">Pakolmo</a>! It modifies the retail version of LSL3 to use a point and click interface instead of the traditional parser. 

## Installation 
Copy all the patch files from either the Spanish or English version into your LSL3 game folder. Note: due to the extreme limitations of SCI0 heap memory, this mod is incompatible with DOSBox - it must be run under ScummVM.
